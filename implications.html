      <p>The ACT REPEALING FOR THE PURPOSE REPUBLIC ACT NO. 9372 OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE
"HUMAN SECURITY ACT (HSA) <br> OF 2007" AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR or the Anti-
Terrorism Bill was passed by the Senate to "prevent and stop" terrorist attacks in the
country by directly targeting individuals who are profiled to be most likely to join
considered terrorist groups or perform such acts.<br><br>
If this bill is passed to be an act, the state and its forces will have the absolute power in defining what constitutes the definition of terrorism, who are to be considered terrorists, and what to do with these individuals. The act itself assumes that the state is the most rational in society, therefore, any suspicion by state institutions such as PNP and AFP is enough bass for being considered terrorists.<br><br>
The Anti-Terror Bill also allows police, law enforcement, and military personnel duly
authorized by the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC) to carry out warrantless arrests without
incurring liability under Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code. Also, the allowable period of detention has been extended to 14 working days, extendible by 10 days.<br><br>
Cases of abuse using the HSA - like those of Lumad leader Jomorito Goaynon and peasant
organizer Ireneo Udarbe - can happen to anyone under this worse bill. They were
arrested on January 28, 2019 in Talakag, Bukidnon. They were charged with illegal
possession of firearms and explosive, violation of the election gun ban, rebellion, and
violations of the HSA.<br><br>
With this bill, the government is in full position to kill dissent and opposition.</p>

    <button class="accordion">Government Tagging of Opposition Affiliated with Terrorist groups</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>• Any member of tagged organizations can be detained or jailed without the chance to appeal.<br>
• Anyone suspected to be a terrorist can be imprisoned with unbailable life sentence.</p>
  <br> <br>

<button class="accordion">Absolute Power for State Institutions to Permit Violation of the Constitution and Human Rights</button>
<div class="panel">
  <br>
  <p>
• Despite the tainted reputation of AFP - PNP in terms of intelligence, factuality, and intention, the bill still assumes that they are the most rational Institution to handle definitions such as terrorism, terrorist acts, etc.<br>
• No check and balance for AFP - PNP. There is an absolute monopoly of power just like what happened during Martial Law.<br>
• Surveillance of suspects and interception and recording of communications will be allowed for 60 days, even on the basis of mere suspicion. The person wiretapped need not be informed.<br>
• Proscription of any individual, organization, association, or group of people shall proceed ex parte, meaning the person/ group involved need not be informed that a petition to proscribe him/her/ them has been filed. <br></p>

    <button class="accordion">Paralysis of Critical and Progressive Activities</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>• Organizers and participants of events or activities that may fall unto the shallow and broad defnition of terrorism by the government can be sanctioned. This effect also happened during Martial law, prohibiting various organizations to function.<br></p>

    <button class="accordion">No One is Safe</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>• As AFP. PP takes control of power and tyranny sits over the Malacanang Palace, they can label anyone as terrorists by virtue of an order, and in a smooth and legal manner.<br></p>
